### Iteration 3 (April 21, 2024)
* Summary of Iteration 3
  1. Local Notification Feature
* Functionality Implementation
  * **Focus Tasks**: 
     * **Creation and Display**: Users can create personalized focus tasks, specifying title, duration, and background picture for the standby screen. All focus tasks are displayed on the main screen for easy access.
     * **Interactive Map**: Users can specify the location for each focus task using an interactive map interface, and this location will then be displayed on a static map. Setting a focus task's location is optional, and users can edit or delete it.
     * **Camera Usage for Background Pictures**: Users can take a picture, choose from their photo album, or select a random one as the background picture for the study session. Setting a background picture is optional, and users can edit or delete it when adding a new focus task, or access the standby screen to select a random one.
     * **Modification**: Users can edit or delete a focus task by tapping the left part of its card.
     * **Start a Focus Session**: The "Start" button on the right initiates a distraction-free study session (Pomodoro) with a countdown timer. Random quotes will be displayed on the standby screen. Users can set a custom background picture, use the default one, or refresh to get a random background picture by pressing the "refresh" button in the top right corner.
     * **Session Completion**: Users can choose to leave the session before the countdown ends or let it finish automatically.
     * **Reminder**: Users can set a notification to remind them to use this app for a study session, based on the repeat mode they choose (Daily, Weekdays, Weekends) and the specific time they set. Users have the option to delete this notification.
     * **Completion Tracking**: Each focus task displays the number of times it has been completed without interruption today.
  * **Groups**:
     * **Creation and Display**: Users can create a new study group and set the target study hours for all members in the group. Groups will be diplayed as a card, with the name of the group, number of group members, and target study hours.
     * **Modification**: The group owner is the one who creates the group. Only the group owner can edit the group's name and target study time for all group members. If the group owner leaves the group, it will be dismissed.
     * **Membership**: Group members can leave a previously joined study group.
     * **Discovery**: Users can search for and join study groups. 
     * **Study Time Display**: Users can view detailed information about each group by tapping on it. This includes the names and the avatars of group members and study time of all group members.
     * **Member Interaction**: Group memebers can acknowledge other members' achievements with a "like" feature.
  * **Dashboard**:
    * **Daily Overview**: Provide a summary of the userâ€™s daily study activities, including total study hours, the number of breaks taken, and the number of sessions completed without interruptions.
    * **Daily Task Breakdown**: Display the daily proportion of study time dedicated to each focus task on a pie chart.

    * **Log out**: Users can log out.

* Navigation Implementation and CRUD operations to Firestore
   * Auth Stack Navigator
     * This navigator is the entry point for unauthenticated users, directing them to either log in or sign up. It incorporates two screens, LoginScreen and SignupScreen, ensuring users can securely access their accounts or create new ones. The Auth Stack Navigator is conditionally rendered based on the authentication state managed through Firebase Authentication. If a user is not authenticated, this navigator is displayed, guiding the user through the authentication process.
   * App Tab Navigator
     * Upon successful authentication, the App Tab Navigator becomes the heart of the application's user interface. It organizes the app's main features into five tabs: Focus List, Study Group, Find Group, Dashboard, and Profile. This navigator enhances the user experience by providing a bottom tab bar for easy navigation between the app's primary features.
   * Focus Stack Navigator
     *  Nested within the App Tab Navigator, the Focus Stack Navigator handles the navigation related to focus tasks. It starts with the FocusScreen, where users can manage their focus tasks. The StandbyScreen is accessible from here, presented modally, to offer users a distraction-free environment for focused study sessions.
   * Group Stack Navigator
     * Nested within the App Tab Navigator, the Group Stack Navigator manages study groups. It begins with the StudyGroupScreen, allowing users to explore and manage their study groups. The GroupDetailsScreen provides detailed information about a specific study group. This navigator illustrates the application's group management features, including joining, creating, and interacting with study groups.
   * Firestore CRUD Operations
     * **Authentication Data**: Manage user accounts, including sign-up and loginã€‚
     * **Focus Tasks and Study Sessions**: Users can create, read, update, and delete focus tasks. Each completion or interruption of a study session is tracked and stored in Firestore, allowing for performance analysis and display on the Dashboard.
     * **Study Groups**: The application supports creating new study groups, joining existing ones, and managing group memberships. All group-related data, including member study times, is handled through Firestoreã€‚
     * **User Profile and Preferences**: User-specific information are managed through Firestore. Users can update their profile usernames.

* Data Model (Collections)
  * **Users Collection**
    * userEmail: String (user's email)
    * userName: String (user's name)
    * status(Optional): String
    * avatar(Optional): String (URL to the user's avatar image)
    * reminder(Optional): An array of objects or strings indicating reminder times and their repeat patterns
    * groups(Optional): An array of objects where each object represents a group the user has interacted with (either by joining or requesting to join).
  * **Focus Collection** (A Sub-collection of User collection)
    * title: String
    * duration: Integer (Expected duration to complete the task, in minutes)
    * location(Optional): An array of objects
    * imageUri: String (URL to the focus's background picture)
    * lastUpdate: Timestamp(when the focus was completed last time)
    * todayBreaks: Integer (Number of breaks today)
    * todayTimes: Integer (Number of completion times today)
    * weeklyStudyTime: An array of length 7
    * monthlyStudyTime: An array of length 12
 
  * **Groups Collection**
    * groupName: String (name of the study group)
    * groupMembers: Array of Objects (each object contains user details and join status)
    * groupOwnerId: String (Document ID of the group owner, referencing a User document)
    * groupTarget: Integer (Target Study Time for This Group)

* CRUD Operations on Collections
   * User Collection
     * **Create**: When a new user signs up, their user details (including userEmail, userName, optional status, optional avatar, and any reminder settings) are created and stored in the Users collection.
     * **Read**: User-specific information is read for profile displays, including their email, name, avatar. The user's group memberships are also read to display the groups they are a part of.
     * **Update**: Users can edit their username, which updates the userName field in the Users collection. If a user sets or modifies reminders, this would update the reminder field. Joining or leaving groups would update the groups field.
     * **Delete**: Deleting a reminder would remove that specific entry from the reminder field in the Users collection. If a user decides to leave a group, that group's information would be removed from the groups field.
   *  Focus Collection (A Sub-collection of the User collection)
      * **Create**: When a user adds a new focus task, a new document is created in the Focus sub-collection with details such as title, duration, optional location, optional imageUri, lastUpdate, todayBreaks, todayTimes, weeklyStudyTime, and monthlyStudyTime.
      * **Read**: The app reads the Focus sub-collection to display all focus tasks on the main screen, including details such as title, duration, location, imageUri, and to track completion, including breaks and completions.
      * **Update**: Editing a focus task (title, duration, location, or imageUri) updates the respective document in the Focus sub-collection. Starting a focus session and either completing it or taking a break updates lastUpdate, todayBreaks, todayTimes, and potentially weeklyStudyTime and monthlyStudyTime fields.
      * **Delete**: When a user deletes a focus task, that specific document is removed from the Focus sub-collection.
    * Groups Collection
      * **Create**: Creating a new study group involves creating a new document in the Groups collection with details like groupName, groupMembers, groupTarget, and groupOwnerId.
      * **Read**: The app reads from the Groups collection to display available study groups for users to join, to show the user's study time alongside other group members, and to allow users to see the details of groups they have joined or are exploring.
      * **Update**: Joining a study group would add a user's details to the groupMembers array of a specific group document. Leaving a group would involve updating the groupMembers field to remove the user.
      * **Delete**: When the owner of a group decides to leave the group, the entire group document is deleted from the Groups collection. If a member (not the group owner) leaves the group, then their useId will be deleted from the group document's groupMembers field.
