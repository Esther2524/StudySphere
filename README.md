2. Navigation Implementation and CRUD operations to Firestore
   * Auth Stack Navigator
     * This navigator is the entry point for unauthenticated users, directing them to either log in or sign up. It incorporates two screens, LoginScreen and SignupScreen, ensuring users can securely access their accounts or create new ones. The Auth Stack Navigator is conditionally rendered based on the authentication state managed through Firebase Authentication. If a user is not authenticated, this navigator is displayed, guiding the user through the authentication process.
   * App Tab Navigator
     * Upon successful authentication, the App Tab Navigator becomes the heart of the application's user interface. It organizes the app's main features into five tabs: Focus List, Study Group, Find Group, Dashboard, and Profile. This navigator enhances the user experience by providing a bottom tab bar for easy navigation between the app's primary features.
   * Focus Stack Navigator
     *  Nested within the App Tab Navigator, the Focus Stack Navigator handles the navigation related to focus tasks. It starts with the FocusScreen, where users can manage their focus tasks. The StandbyScreen is accessible from here, presented modally, to offer users a distraction-free environment for focused study sessions.
   * Group Stack Navigator
     * Nested within the App Tab Navigator, the Group Stack Navigator manages study groups. It begins with the StudyGroupScreen, allowing users to explore and manage their study groups. The GroupDetailsScreen provides detailed information about a specific study group. This navigator illustrates the application's group management features, including joining, creating, and interacting with study groups.
