* Navigation Implementation and CRUD operations to Firestore
   * Auth Stack Navigator
     * This navigator is the entry point for unauthenticated users, directing them to either log in or sign up. It incorporates two screens, LoginScreen and SignupScreen, ensuring users can securely access their accounts or create new ones. The Auth Stack Navigator is conditionally rendered based on the authentication state managed through Firebase Authentication. If a user is not authenticated, this navigator is displayed, guiding the user through the authentication process.
   * App Tab Navigator
     * Upon successful authentication, the App Tab Navigator becomes the heart of the application's user interface. It organizes the app's main features into five tabs: Focus List, Study Group, Find Group, Dashboard, and Profile. This navigator enhances the user experience by providing a bottom tab bar for easy navigation between the app's primary features.
   * Focus Stack Navigator
     *  Nested within the App Tab Navigator, the Focus Stack Navigator handles the navigation related to focus tasks. It starts with the FocusScreen, where users can manage their focus tasks. The StandbyScreen is accessible from here, presented modally, to offer users a distraction-free environment for focused study sessions.
   * Group Stack Navigator
     * Nested within the App Tab Navigator, the Group Stack Navigator manages study groups. It begins with the StudyGroupScreen, allowing users to explore and manage their study groups. The GroupDetailsScreen provides detailed information about a specific study group. This navigator illustrates the application's group management features, including joining, creating, and interacting with study groups.
   * Firestore CRUD Operations
     * **Authentication Data**: Manage user accounts, including sign-up and loginã€‚
     * **Focus Tasks and Study Sessions**: Users can create, read, update, and delete focus tasks. Each completion or interruption of a study session is tracked and stored in Firestore, allowing for performance analysis and display on the Dashboard.
     * **Study Groups**: The application supports creating new study groups, joining existing ones, and managing group memberships. All group-related data, including member study times, is handled through Firestoreã€‚
     * **User Profile and Preferences**: User-specific information are managed through Firestore. Users can update their profile usernames.

* Data Model (Collections)

    * userEmail: String (user's email)
    * userName: String (user's name)
    * status(Optional): String
    * avatar(Optional): String (URL to the user's avatar image)
    * reminder(Optional): An array of objects or strings indicating reminder times and their repeat patterns
    * groups(Optional): An array of objects where each object represents a group the user has interacted with (either by joining or requesting to join).
  * **Focus Collection** (A Sub-collection of User collection)
    * title: String
    * duration: Integer (Expected duration to complete the task, in minutes)
    * location(Optional): An array of objects
    * lastUpdate: Timestamp(when the focus was completed last time)
    * todayBreaks: Integer (Number of breaks today)
    * todayTimes: Integer (Number of completion times today)
    * weeklyStudyTime: An array of length 7
    * monthlyStudyTime: An array of length 12
  * **Groups Collection**
    * groupName: String (name of the study group)
    * groupMembers: Array of Objects (each object contains user details and join status)
    * groupOwnerId: String (Document ID of the group owner, referencing a User document)

* CRUD Operations on Collections
   * User Collection
     * **Create**: When a new user signs up, their user details (including userEmail, userName, optional status, optional avatar, and any reminder settings) are created and stored in the Users collection.
     * **Read**: User-specific information is read for profile displays, including their email, name, avatar. The user's group memberships are also read to display the groups they are a part of.
     * **Update**: Users can edit their username, which updates the userName field in the Users collection. If a user sets or modifies reminders, this would update the reminder field. Joining or leaving groups would update the groups field.
     * **Delete**: Deleting a reminder would remove that specific entry from the reminder field in the Users collection. If a user decides to leave a group, that group's information would be removed from the groups field.
   *  Focus Collection (A Sub-collection of the User collection)
      * **Create**: When a user adds a new focus task, a new document is created in the Focus sub-collection with details such as title, duration, optional location, lastUpdate, todayBreaks, todayTimes, weeklyStudyTime, and monthlyStudyTime.
      * **Read**: The app reads the Focus sub-collection to display all focus tasks on the main screen, including details like title and duration, and to show completion tracking such as breaks and completions.
      * **Update**: Editing a focus task (title or duration) updates the respective document in the Focus sub-collection. Starting a focus session and either completing it or taking a break updates lastUpdate, todayBreaks, todayTimes, and potentially weeklyStudyTime and monthlyStudyTime fields.
      * **Delete**: When a user deletes a focus task, that specific document is removed from the Focus sub-collection.
    * Groups Collection
      * **Create**: Creating a new study group involves creating a new document in the Groups collection with details like groupName, groupMembers, and groupOwnerId.
      * **Read**: The app reads from the Groups collection to display available study groups for users to join, to show the user's study time alongside other group members, and to allow users to see the details of groups they have joined or are exploring.
      * **Update**: Joining a study group would add a user's details to the groupMembers array of a specific group document. Leaving a group would involve updating the groupMembers field to remove the user.
      * **Delete**: When the owner of a group decides to leave the group, the entire group document is deleted from the Groups collection.
